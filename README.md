## Overview

This is a Turing School of Software and Design - Module 2 solo project.

## The Application

This game consists of 30 flashcards that each pose a multiple choice question about the JavaScript programming language. The user can type in their answer and recieve immediate feedback. Once they have completed all 30 flashcards, the game will print out the percentage of questions the user answered correctly.
